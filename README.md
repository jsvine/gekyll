# Gekyll

Gekyll is a [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) plugin that lets you use Git repositories as posts, giving you access to a post's version history.

## Getting Started

- Copy `gekyll.rb` from this repository into your Jekyll project's `_plugins` directory.
- Gekyll depends on the [Grit](https://github.com/mojombo/grit/) gem. So install it: `gem install grit`.
